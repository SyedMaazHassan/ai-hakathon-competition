        "If a field is unknown or not explicitly present, set it to null (for scalars) or [] (for lists). Do NOT guess.",

        # NORMALIZATION
        "Emails: trim whitespace and strip any leading 'mailto:'; if invalid after trimming, set to null.",
        "Apply the same email trimming/validation to professional_references[].email.",
        "Normalize skills/tools: extract verbatim mentions into the appropriate places (technical_skills[].name and work_experience[].technologies_used / projects[].technologies).",

        "Lowercase, trim, and case-insensitively de-duplicate normalized_skills, normalized_tools, and normalized_titles.",
        "If a skill line includes specific named technologies in parentheses/notes (e.g., 'relational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL)'), keep the capability as a Skill in technical_skills (e.g., 'relational databases'), and add the named technologies to normalized_tools; when the context is clear, also add them to the nearest relevant work_experience[].technologies_used or projects[].technologies.",
        "Do NOT create job-style requirement groups or required/preferred tool buckets—those do not exist in the resume schema.",
        "Normalize titles: convert job titles to lowercase canonical forms and populate normalized_titles (e.g., 'Sr. Software Eng.' → 'senior software engineer').",

        # LANGUAGE / LEVEL MAPPING
        "Languages: include Language entries when listed. Set 'proficiency' only if explicitly stated or clearly implied; map 'fluent'/C1/C2→'advanced', B2→'intermediate'; otherwise leave 'proficiency' null.",
        "Map emphasis words ('extensively used', 'expertise in', 'hands-on', 'proficient with') to Skill.level as 'advanced' or 'expert' only when the claim is explicit; otherwise leave null.",

        # EDUCATION-SPECIFIC GUARDRAILS
        "Set education[].gpa only when clearly on a 4.0 scale; if another scale is detected (e.g., 10.0, 5.0), leave gpa null and store a note in extra_information['gpa_note'] (e.g., 'reported as 8.7/10').",

        # DATES
        "For any date fields, use DateModel and fill only what's present. Examples: year → {'year': 2021, 'original': '2021 – Present'}; month+year → {'year': 2021, 'month': 5, 'original': 'May 2021'}; full date → include day.",

        "total_years_experience: compute ONLY if all work experiences have computable start and end (or is_current) dates and time intervals are non-overlapping; otherwise set null. Do not estimate.",

        # ENUMS & HYGIENE
        "Enums (SkillLevel, EducationLevel, EmploymentType, WorkLocationType, SeniorityLevel): use only allowed enum values; map common synonyms to valid enums ('FT'→full_time, 'Contractor'→contract); if mapping is unclear, set null.",
        "Phone numbers: normalize to digits with an optional leading '+'.",
        "URLs: return the canonical URL string as seen (trim whitespace only).",
        "Split bullet-like lines into list items where appropriate (responsibilities, achievements, etc.) without altering the wording.",
        "Maintain the resume’s implied chronological order for experiences/education.",
        "Trim whitespace on all scalars; if empty after trimming, set null. For lists, dedupe case-insensitively; return [] if empty.",

        # DERIVED SIGNALS (for scoring)
        "Populate derived_skills_matrix when any signal exists: key = normalized skill/tool; value = { 'years': float|null, 'level': SkillLevel|null, 'category': str|null }. Include an entry only if at least one of these can be determined; otherwise leave derived_skills_matrix as {}.",
        "Only include keys in derived_skills_matrix that also appear in normalized_skills or normalized_tools (keep them in sync).",

        # WORK PREFERENCES / AUTH
        "If present, fill work_preferences (preferred_work_location_type, willing_to_relocate, max_onsite_radius_km, travel_preference_pct, time_zone, availability_date).",
        "If present, fill compensation_expectation (currency, desired_min, desired_max, period, flexibility_note).",
        "Authorization: fill personal_info.work_authorization verbatim; for visa_support_needed and security_clearance use their enums if provided.",

        # PROVENANCE
        # "Populate field_sources as a mapping from field path to the source location/phrase in the resume. Example: personal_info.full_name → 'Header, line 1'; work_experience[0].company → 'Page 1: SW Global Limited'.",

        # METADATA
        "Set parsing_confidence in [0,1] with rubric: 0.95–1.0 all sections confidently mapped; 0.7–0.94 mostly mapped with some nulls; 0.4–0.69 many gaps; <0.4 severe ambiguity.",

        # SAFETY
        "Never fabricate institutions, companies, dates, roles, certifications, or achievements.",
        "If the resume has contradictory or malformed data, set the affected fields to null and add an explanation in extra_information with prefix 'conflict_note: ...'.",

        # FINAL VALIDATION
        "Before returning, validate that the JSON parses, enums are valid, and if both dates include at least a year (and month when present) then assert end_date >= start_date; otherwise skip the comparison."
