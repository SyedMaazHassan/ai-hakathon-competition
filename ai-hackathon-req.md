We are working on AI Hackathon project. We have selected the problem statement in Files. We are given a problem (project) where we need to build multi agent system. We will use google gemini API keys are we are going to use agno.com as a agent framework. 

You need to help us in :
- managing time. It stats at 12:30 pm 27 sept. 2025, and we need to submit it by 28 sept. 2025 morning 10 am.
- Make a very good design document
- Project Hackathon development
- Edge cases in shorter time
- Strategy to win / present and do the prototype. 


CRITERIA FROM JUDGES:

COMMON FOR ALL CHALLENGES

Degraded Mode — Guidance for Participants and Judges

Definition:
A degraded mode is a simplified or fallback version of the system that remains functional when resources
are constrained — e.g., poor internet, limited compute, or cost restrictions.
Implementation of Degraded mode will be mandatory for all challenges.
Expectations for Participants:
- Provide an offline or low-bandwidth alternative (e.g., preloaded data, compressed models, static
responses).
- Implement token-efficient prompts or summarization to reduce API costs.
- Design a lightweight interface that still delivers the core user value when advanced features are
unavailable.
Evaluation by Judges:
- Does the solution provide usable functionality without requiring high-speed internet or expensive API
calls?
- Does the degraded mode demonstrate graceful fallback (not just crash or error out)?
- Is the degraded mode relevant for developing-world contexts (e.g., shared devices, low RAM, patchy
connections)?
- Is there clear documentation or demo evidence of how degraded mode works?

Our challenge / project that we are building.

NATIONAL AGENTIC AI HACKATHON

Frontline Worker Support AI

Problem:
Frontline workers (triage nurses, emergency officers, council staff, social services, crime responders) and
citizens both struggle with long queues, unclear protocols, and slow case handling. Citizens often don’t
know where to go, while staff face overwhelming workloads.
Challenge:
Build a multi-agent AI system that bridges citizens and frontline workers by:
- Triage Agent (Frontline): Analyzes case data (type of emergency, citizen requests) and decides
urgency.
- Guidance Agent (Frontline): Matches case to the right service (hospital department, emergency
team, any other service).
- Booking Agent (Citizen-facing): Autonomously books appointments, pre-fills forms, or drafts
emails/SMS to the right office.
- Follow-up Agent (Citizen-facing): Sends reminders, tracks service progress, and explains updates in
plain language.
- Equity Oversight Agent: Tracks service demand vs. capacity and generates insights for
administrators.
Dataset: Mock emergency requests by the citizens, list of hospitals, wards etc.
Deliverables:
- Working demo of emergency service agent
- The AI agents collaborate to assess the case → find the right service → autonomously book an
appointment/fill the form → provide a plain-language confirmation (e.g., “Appointment booked at XYZ
clinic tomorrow at 9am. Bring your ID card.”).
- Must include a degraded mode for offline, low-bandwidth, or low-cost usage.

OUR GOAL:
- To win this AI Hackathon by making a useful, perfect mvp and win cash prize and geuninely make the problem solving product. We are allowed to show our creativity in making the original requirement fulfilled + we can add any useful feature.

NOTE: some files are added as a data provided by the management of hackaton, but we are allowed to use.
